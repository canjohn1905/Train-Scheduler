# Train-Scheduler

This a web app which alows user to input train time and calculate Next Arrival and how many minutes the train is away! It can be used for any websites which are using schedule and time table.

I did minimal changes on HTML and fully coded the javascripts to make the functions work.

What it does?
You can input train time 
It will return a data
such as arriving time and how far it is from the user's location
it takes military time and converts it as well.

Improvments?
I could work on the functionallity which converts the time to another format
